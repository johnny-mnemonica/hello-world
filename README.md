Hello world! ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website.

# Getting Started

## Running the Dev Server :boom:

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve```

Fun fact: The --serve flag enables hot reloading. 

# TODOs
## Jan 2025
- Minify JS and CSS, code splitting to improve performance.
- Lazy load images.
- Improve font rendering.
  - Consider loading fonts with JS to fix FOUT - but is thorwing more JS at the problem really the answer?
  - I could find a better fallback font, too.
- Fix bug with link text-decoration, flash on load.
  - This seems to be a Chrome issue.
- Improve SEO, add missing meta tags.
- Change link color on slider input to improve contrast.
