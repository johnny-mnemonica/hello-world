Since 2022, I've had the pleasure of working with [Off-Paper Creative Agency](http://www.offpapercreative.com) as their lead Shopify Developer. I've developed 10+ websites spanning multiple industries, building out theme sections, features, and custom e-commerce solutions to meet our clients' unique needs. As a lead, I've also developed internal workflows and trained other developers as they've joined the Off-Paper team.
