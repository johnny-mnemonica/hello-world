Speaking of Elysium - I designed and built Elysium's <i>Scene Share</i> - giving users the ability to generate a sharable URL to promote their AR scene outside of the app. I built out this feature using Next.js + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS. <i>If the URL is viewed on an iOS device, the user can click on a deeplink that will direct them to the AR scene within Elysium.</i>
