[Elysium](https://elysium.ar/) is a no code, augmented reality world-building application made for iOS devices. Developed by [Mythologi XR](https://mythologi.es/), Elysium allows users to create a geolocated, AR 'scene' using 2D, 3D and audio assets to create immersive expriences that are viewable to anyone within the physical bounds of the scene.

I had the chance to design and develop Elysium's landing page - using Spline and Three.js to build out WebGL components. I also experimented with scroll events to create scale animations (viewable on desktop). One of the challenges I faced was troubleshooting various edge cases - partiularly with reload and window resize events - to ensure the animation runs smootly and accurately reflects the user's scroll position.
