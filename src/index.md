It seems like you've stumbled upon my little piece of the web. 

 &nbsp;

Let me introduce myself. If I could offer you a cup of tea, I would.

 &nbsp;

 My name is Monica, and I'm a web developer and designer, among other things.
&nbsp; 

 I currently work part-time as a Shopify Developer at [Off-Paper Creative Agency](http://www.offpapercreative.com).
